                       TAME V3.0b Release Notes 
                       ------------------------
                       
                       
- New feature: Access to PLC variables by name is now possible. Internally 
  IndexGroup/IndexOffset is used instead of handles, so a visualisation
  has to be reloaded in the browser when the PLC program has changed.
  
- New feature: Multiple PLC variables can be read by a SumReadRequest. The 
  advantage over the standart ReadRequest is that variables don't have to be
  located. TwinCAT V2.10 Build >= 1324 is needed to use this feature!
