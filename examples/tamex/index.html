                    <p>
                        An example using the basic methods "readReq" and "writeReq".<br />
                        You can read or write multiple variables with one request.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="basic/index.html">Single Requests</a>
                    <p>
                        This is an example for writing and reading single variables.<br />
                        Cyclic polling is also included.

                    <p>
                        An example for reading and writing arrays.
                    </p>
                </li>

                        A demo how to make live easier using sructures.

                    <p>
                        The "high-end" feature of the library: Read or write an array of<br />
                        structures with one request. I've already used it for fetching<br />
                        an array with more than 2000 values.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><a href="extjs/index.html">Example Using Ext JS 4</a>
                    <p>
                        I'm new to Ext and just played around with some demos provided<br />
                        by the developers. But I think the store system of Ext suites<br />
                        quite well with TAME, especially using structures. But see for<br />
                        yourself. This applies also to Sencha Touch, so it's worth having<br />
                        a look at if you plan developing an application for mobile devices.<br />
