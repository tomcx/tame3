To use the examples:

- Edit "tamex\resources\webservice.js" and change the parameters of the webservice to your needs.
- Copy the "tamex"-folder to your webserver with the ADS-Webservice installed.
- Open the "plc\demo.pro" in TwinCAT 2 ("demo_TC3" is for TwinCAT 3), build and run it on your PLC.
- Open "http:\\your_web_server\tamex\index.html" with your favorite browser.



The file "test_sum_commands.zip" contains a test of reading/writing a structure and an array
of structures with sum commands. I haven't added those features to the examples, so take a
look at the code in this file if you want to know more about it.
